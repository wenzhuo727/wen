## Abstract
As a key variable to characterize the process of crop growth, the aboveground biomass (aGB) plays an
important role in crop management and production. Process-based models and remote sensing are
two important scientifc methods for crop AGB estimation. In this study, we combined observations
from agricultural meteorological stations and county-level yield statistics to calibrate a process-based
crop growth model for winter wheat. After that, we assimilated a reprocessed temporal-spatial fltered
MODIS Leaf Area Index product into the model to derive the 1 km daily AGB dataset of the main winter
wheat producing areas in China from 2007 to 2015. The validation using ground measurements also
suggests the derived AGB dataset agrees well with the fled observations, i.e., the R2 is above 0.9,
and the root mean square error (RMSE) reaches 1,377 kg·ha−1. Compared to county-level statistics
during 2007–2015, the ranges of R2, RMSE, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 0.73~0.89,
953~1,503 kg·ha−1, and 8%~12%, respectively. We believe our dataset can be helpful for relevant
studies on regional agricultural production management and yield estimation.
