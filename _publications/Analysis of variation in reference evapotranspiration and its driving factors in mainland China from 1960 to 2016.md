## Abstract
Understanding the variation in reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is vital for hydrological cycles,
drought monitoring, and water resource management. With 1507 meteorological stations and 130
radiation-measured stations, the annual and seasonal ETo were calculated at each site from 1960 to
2016 in mainland China. The phenomenon of coefficient ‘a’ being less than 0.25 and coefficient ‘b’
being greater than 0.50 in the Angstrom–Prescott model occurred in almost the whole country,
except for a small area of western and northeastern China. Moreover, the Xiao’s method was more
applicable to calculate the net longwave radiation (Rnl) and then improve the estimation accuracy
of ETo. The annual ETo varied from 538.8 to 1559.8 mm and had a high-value center located in the
plateau and desert of northwestern China and a low-value center located in Northeast China and
near the Sichuan Basin. The spatial distribution of seasonal ETo was roughly similar to that of
annual ETo, except for that in winter when ETo was high in the south and low in the north. In
mainland China, the annual ETo decreased by 21.2 mm decade−1 because of the declining sunshine
duration before 1993 and increased by 21.1 mm decade−1 due to the decreased relative humidity
(RH) after 1993. Generally, the abrupt change of ETo mainly occurred in the southern China rather
than northern China (except for Qinghai Tibet Plateau). Basically, the dominant driving factors of
annual and seasonal ETo were RH and/or Tmax after the abrupt change in most parts of China.
