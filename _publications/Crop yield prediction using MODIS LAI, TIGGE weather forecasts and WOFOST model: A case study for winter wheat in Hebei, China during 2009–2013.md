## Abstract
Timely and reliable in-season forecasting of crop yield is crucial for regional and national agricultural management. To improve the winter wheat yield prediction accuracy at the regional scale, we developed a data
assimilation scheme that assimilated the MODIS leaf area index (LAI) into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST)
model. The meteorological data of the WOFOST model include current weather data, 15-day THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) forecast dataset and weather forecast data generated by TIGGE forecast
and historical meteorological data (1979–2008) using the vectorial angle method. The WOFOST model was
calibrated within 10 subregions of Hebei province based on feld measured winter wheat growth data from each
corresponding agrometeorological station to account for the spatial variability of crop and soil parameters to
some extent, and the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) fltered MODIS LAI was then assimilated into the WOFOST model for
regional winter wheat yield forecasting. We constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar)
cost function to account for the observations and model errors from Feb. 10th to Apr. 30th, and the Shufﬂed
Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was used to minimize the cost function by reinitializing three WOFOST parameters. The winter wheat yield forecasting date was started from Apr. 30th, and the
results showed that assimilating MODIS LAI into the WOFOST model substantially improved the accuracy of
regional wheat yield predictions (R = 0.60, CCC = 0.53, RMSE = 619.73 kg/ha) compared with the unassimilated results (R = 0.35, CCC = 0.24, RMSE = 857.32 kg/ha), and the relative error (RE) between the averaged
predicted yield and offcial statistics for most cities decreased after data assimilation. This demonstrated that
assimilating MODIS LAI can optimize the simulation of LAI in the WOFOST model, thereby further reduce the
uncertainty of yield forecasting. These promising results highlighted the potential of integrating remotely sensed
data, crop model and weather forecasts for in-season prediction of crop yield at the regional scale.
