## Abstract
Massive desert locust swarms have been threatening and devouring natural vegetation
and agricultural crops in East Africa and West Asia since 2019, and the event developed into a rare
and globally concerning locust upsurge in early 2020. The breeding, maturation, concentration and
migration of locusts rely on appropriate environmental factors, mainly precipitation, temperature,
vegetation coverage and land-surface soil moisture. Remotely sensed images and long-term meteorological observations across the desert locust invasion area were analyzed to explore the complex
drivers, vegetation losses and growing trends during the locust upsurge in this study. The results
revealed that (1) the intense precipitation events in the Arabian Peninsula during 2018 provided
suitable soil moisture and lush vegetation, thus promoting locust breeding, multiplication and gregarization; (2) the regions affected by the heavy rainfall in 2019 shifted from the Arabian Peninsula to
West Asia and Northeast Africa, thus driving the vast locust swarms migrating into those regions
and causing enormous vegetation loss; (3) the soil moisture and NDVI anomalies corresponded well
with the locust swarm movements; and (4) there was a low chance the eastwardly migrating locust
swarms would fly into the Indochina Peninsula and Southwest China.

## Key words
