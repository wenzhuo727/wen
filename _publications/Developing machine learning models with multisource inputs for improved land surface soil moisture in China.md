## Abstract
Accurate and spatially continuous land surface soil moisture (SSM) data will greatly beneft analyses of heat
transfer, energy exchange and agricultural dryness. To obtain spatiotemporally consistent SSM information, five
machine learning (ML) models, i.e., polynomial regression (PR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LR),
elastic net regression (EnR) and random forest regression (RfR) models, were generated to map the regional SSM
in the 0–10 cm soil layer across the study area. Multiple features, including the geographical location, elevation,
vegetation coverage, soil texture, seasonal patterns and satellite-retrieved SSM product from Fengyun-3C (FY-
3C), were selected as the input variables for the proposed ML models. In situ SSM measurements from the
Chinese Automatic Soil Moisture Observation Stations (CASMOS) were used as the reference dataset. The error
metrics, including the coeffcient of correlation (R), mean relative error (MRE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) and
mean absolute error (MAE), between the measured SSM values and those estimated using the different models
were calculated. Among those ML models, the RfR model showed the best performance in the training (R =
0.981, MRE = 7.3%, ubRMSE = 0.021 cm3/cm3, and MAE = 0.015 cm3/cm3) and testing (R = 0.789, MRE =
22.2%, ubRMSE = 0.065 cm3/cm3, and MAE = 0.047 cm3/cm3) processes and was applied to map the regional
SSM values and measure the importance of each input feature. The results indicated that geographical location, i.
e., latitude (35.84%) and longitude (16.96%), contributed the most to the SSM estimation model, followed by
elevation (14.88%), vegetation coverage (9.75%), the FY-3C SSM product (8.30%), the soil texture (8.04%) and
seasonal patterns (6.23%). In addition, the SSM estimations across mainland China matched the spatiotemporal
patterns of historical precipitation well, which indicated the feasibility of achieving accurate and consistent land
surface (0–10 cm) soil moisture monitoring results using the established RfR model with appropriately selected
input features.
