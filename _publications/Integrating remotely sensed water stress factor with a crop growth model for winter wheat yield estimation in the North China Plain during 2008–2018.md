## Abstract
Accurate estimation of regional-scale crop yield under drought conditions allows farmers and agricultural
agencies to make well-informed decisions and guide agronomic management. However, few studies have
focused on using the crop model data assimilation (CMDA) method for regional-scale winter wheat yield
estimation under drought stress and partial-irrigation conditions. In this study, we developed a CMDA
framework to integrate remotely sensed water stress factor (MOD16 ET/PET) with the WOFOST model
using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale in the
North China Plain (NCP) during 2008–2018. According to our results, integration of MOD16 ET/PET with
the WOFOST model produced more accurate estimates of regional winter wheat yield than open-loop
simulation. The correlation coefficient of simulated yield with statistical yield increased for each year
and error decreased in most years, with r ranging from 0.28 to 0.65 and RMSE ranging from 700.08 to
1966.12 kg/ha. Yield estimation using the CMDA method was more suitable in drought years
(r = 0.47, RMSE = 919.04 kg/ha) than in normal years (r = 0.30, RMSE = 1215.51 kg/ha). Our approach
performed better in yield estimation under drought conditions than the conventional empirical correlation method using vegetation condition index (VCI). This research highlighted the potential of assimilating remotely sensed water stress factor, which can account for irrigation benefit, into crop model for
improving the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale especially under drought
conditions, and this approach can be easily adapted to other regions and crops.
