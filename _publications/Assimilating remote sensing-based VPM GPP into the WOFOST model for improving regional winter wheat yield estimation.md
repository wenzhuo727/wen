## Abstract
Crop growth models are powerful tools for predicting crop growth and yield. Gross primary production (GPP) is a
major photosynthetic ﬂux that is directly linked to crop grain yield. To better understand the potential of GPP for
regional crop yield estimation, in this study, a novel crop data-model assimilation (CDMA) framework was
proposed that assimilates accumulative GPP estimates from the satellite-based vegetation photosynthesis model
(VPM) into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model using the ensemble Kalman flter (EnKF) algorithm to
estimate winter wheat GPP and grain yield. Results showed that the WOFOST simulated GPP agreed with the
GPPEC derived from eddy ﬂux tower (R2 = 0.74 and 0.47 in 2015 and 2016, respectively). Assimilating GPPVPM
into the WOFOST model improved site-scale GPP estimation (R2 = 0.87 and 0.67 in 2015 and 2016, respectively), and also improved regional-scale winter wheat yield estimates (R2 = 0.36 and 0.29; RMSE= 479 and 572
kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively) compared with the open loop simulations (R2 = 0.14 and 0.10; RMSE=
801 and 788 kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively). Our study demonstrated that assimilation of remotely sensed
GPP optimized the results of carbon simulation in the WOFOST model and highlighted the potential of GPP for
regional winter wheat yield estimation using a data assimilation framework.
