1. **Wen, Zhuo**; Jianxi, Huang; Xiangming, Xiao; Hai, Huang; Rajen, Bajgain; Xiaocui, Wu; Xinran, Gao; Jie, Wang; Xuecao, Li; Pradeep, Wagle. [Assimilating remote sensing-based VPM GPP into the WOFOST model for improving regional winter wheat yield estimation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126556). **European Journal of Agronomy**, 2022; 139(11), 126556.
   * In this study, a novel crop data-model assimilation framework was proposed that assimilates accumulative GPP estimates from the VPM model into the WOFOST model using EnKF algorithm to estimate winter wheat GPP and grain yield.
