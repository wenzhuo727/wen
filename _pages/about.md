Hi! My name is Wen Zhuo, currently a postdoctoral researcher in [School of Earth, Environment & Scociety](https://sees.mcmaster.ca/), [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), supervised by Prof. [Alemu Gonsamo](https://remotesensing-mcmaster.org/). Now, my core research interests center around crop yield estimation and prediction. To address this research question, my research leverages various methods, including process-based model (mainly WOFOST model), data assimilation (integrates remotely sensed observations with crop model), and deep learning.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach me to discuss relevant research and topics by email: zhuowen1992@foxmail.com.

## ðŸ”¥ Recent News (this year)

**[Mar. 2024]** 
* I will attend [**EGU2024**](https://www.egu24.eu/) at Vienna, Austria in person during Apr. 14-19 (for the first time to attend the assembly).

* New paper led by Jiahao Han was published in [Science of the Total Environment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.169992). The main topic is about the time-continuous LST data simulation using deep learning (U-Net family) [Download paper here](https://wenzhuo727.github.io/wen/files/STE2024.pdf)

**[Feb. 2024]** 
* The [abstract](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-4191.html) submitted to [**EGU2024**](https://www.egu24.eu/) is already online.

* New paper led by [Dr. Yanru Yu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanru-Yu-2) was published in [IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing](https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2024.3368707). This study is to achieve the simple and rapid acquisition of high-precision all-weather high temporal and spatial resolution daily mean land surface temperature data.
