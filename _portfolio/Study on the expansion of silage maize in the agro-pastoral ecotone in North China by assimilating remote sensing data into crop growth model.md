## Abstract
The northern agro-pastoral ecotone is a significant region connecting the eastern
agricultural areas and the western grassland pastoral areas in China. However, the
long-term imbalance of grain and feed structure poses considerable challenges to
the sustainable development of local agriculture and animal husbandry. To address
this issue, the government has proposed the agricultural planting structure
adjustment strategy focusing on reducing grain and increasing feed, primarily by
reducing grain corn and expanding silage corn and other high-quality forages.
However, systematic research is currently lacking on how to reduce grain corn,
where to expand silage corn, and how to ensure comprehensive income during
adjustment and expanding process.
To address these gaps, the project plans to use the data assimilation method to
couple the remote sensing observation data of MODIS leaf area index and
evapotranspiration time series with WOFOST crop growth model.This will enable the
simulation of the yield spatial distribution of silage corn under the same water
consumption as grain corn, based on evaluating the water consumption and yield
status of grain corn in the northern agro-pastoral ecotone. By comparing and
analyzing the water consumption per unit yield of grain maize and silage maize, as
well as the comprehensive income before and after grain maize reduction (loss) and
silage maize expansion (profit), the key areas of silage corn expansion will be
determined scientifically and reasonably. The results are expected to provide a
scientific basis for the adjustment of agricultural planting structure in the
northern agro-pastoral ecotone
