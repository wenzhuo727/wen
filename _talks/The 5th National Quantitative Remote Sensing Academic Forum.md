I attend the 5th National Quantitative Remote Sensing Academic Forum in person, and I mainly introduced the research about winter wheat yield prediction by integrating MODIS LAI, WOFOST model and TIGGE weather forecasts. This work was then published in [International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102668), or [Download paper here](https://wenzhuo727.github.io/wen/files/JAG2021.pdf).
