I attend the 2018 GIS Day at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, and I mainly introduced the research about how to use remotely sensed GPP data for winter wheat yield estimation using crop model data assimilation method. This study is part of the work of our paper published in [European Journal of Agronomy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126556), you can [Download paper here](https://wenzhuo727.github.io/wen/files/EJA2022.pdf).
