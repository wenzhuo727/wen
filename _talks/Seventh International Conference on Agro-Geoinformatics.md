I attend the Seventh International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics in Hangzhou, and I mainly introduced the research about how to combine SAR and optical remotely sensed observations for winter wheat yield estimation. This work was then published in [Remote Sensing](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11131618), you can [Download paper here](https://wenzhuo727.github.io/wen/files/remotesensing2019.pdf).
